Frame-level Visual Search,LAB,⚠️ Partial,V1 (3mo),Medium,$10k-20k (CLIP integration + vector DB),"Works at ~70% accuracy with CLIP. Won't understand cinematography like promised without custom models. Good enough for MVP but not DP-grade precision.",Medium,Third-party API,Profitable
Personal Reference Library,LAB,✅ Works,V1 (3mo),Low,$2k-5k (basic CRUD),Straightforward CRUD operations. No technical risk.,Weak,,Profitable
AI Pitch Deck Generation,STAGE,⚠️ Partial,V2 (6mo),Medium,$15k-30k (NLP + template system),"It's keyword matching + layout automation, NOT intelligent scene understanding. Can extract scene headings and keyword match, but won't understand ""tense confrontation in brutalist architecture."" Still valuable as automated layout tool.",Weak,"Third-party API, Manual Curation",Profitable
PDF Mood Board Export,LAB,✅ Works,V1 (3mo),Low,$2k-5k (jsPDF integration),Mature libraries exist. No technical risk.,None,,Profitable
Real-time Multiplayer Editing,STAGE,⚠️ Partial,V3 (12mo),Very High,"$100k-200k (CRDT, WebSockets, infrastructure)","Basic shared state works (5-10 sec lag). True Figma-level multiplayer requires 6-12 months eng work + ongoing infrastructure costs. Ship basic version in V2, real-time in V3.",Medium,Infrastructure,Break-even
Shot List Builder,STAGE,✅ Works,V1 (3mo),Low,$5k-10k (spreadsheet + attachments),Just UI work. Spreadsheet with ability to attach frames from LAB.,Weak,,Profitable
Frame Comments & Annotations,Both,✅ Works,V1 (3mo),Low,$5k-10k (comment system),Standard feature. Database + UI for comments.,Weak,,Profitable
Team Workspaces & Permissions,Both,✅ Works,V2 (6mo),Medium,$20k-40k (auth system + billing),Standard auth/permissions. Adds operational overhead (user management billing per team).,Medium,,Profitable
Runway API Integration,STAGE,⚠️ Partial,V2 (6mo),Medium,$10k integration + usage costs,WORKS but unit economics don't work at $19/mo unlimited. Runway charges $0.10-0.50 per generation. Must cap at 10 gens/month for Pro or charge usage-based pricing. Cannot offer unlimited at flat rate.,Weak,Third-party API,Negative (if unlimited) / Profitable (if capped)
Advanced Search Filters (Composition/Lighting),LAB,⚠️ Partial,Series A (18mo+),Very High,$500k+ (custom CV models expert labeling),"Color extraction works (easy). Shot type trainable ($50k). Composition/lighting analysis requires custom models + expert cinematographers to label training data ($100k-500k). NOT realistic for V1-2. Start with manual tags, train simple models over time.",Strong (when built),"Custom AI, Expert Labeling",Profitable (long-term)
Cinematography-Specific AI Models,Both,❌ Doesn't Work,Series A (18mo+),Very High,"$500k-1M (research team, GPU clusters, labeling)","Requires labeled dataset (expert cinematographers tagging 100k+ frames = $100k-500k labor) + custom model training + researcher + GPU clusters. 12-18 months minimum. This is THE moat but not accessible until Series A funding.",Strong,"Custom AI, Expert Labeling",Profitable (long-term)
Visual Similarity Search (Color),LAB,✅ Works,V1 (3mo),Low,"$5k-10k (OpenCV, color-thief)",Color palette extraction is Computer Vision 101. Works perfectly.,None,,Profitable
