# CineBox MVP: One-Page Summary

## What You're Building
**Films career platform with visual dataset moat**
- Filmmakers upload projects → Get studio matches → Contact info
- $49/mo SaaS → $50k ARR in 60 days → Fundable

## The Moat
**Visual Dataset (Not the features)**
- Week 1: 200 curated films × 12 frames = 2,400 frames
- Month 6: +30,000 user-generated frames = 32,400 total
- Year 2: Train proprietary visual AI (better than CLIP)
- Year 3: Expand to games/ads with same dataset
- Year 5: Exit to Adobe/Blackmagic ($100M-500M)

## The Decision (Choose Now)

### Path A: No-Code (RECOMMENDED)
**Timeline:** 7 days | **Cost:** $1,320 + $70/mo | **Code:** Zero
- Day 1: Setup (Softr + Airtable + Stripe)
- Day 2-4: Curate dataset (hire 2 students)
- Day 5-6: Build product (Softr pages)
- Day 7: Launch (Reddit, Twitter, Product Hunt)

**Pros:** Fast, cheap, focus on dataset (the moat)
**Cons:** Limited matching, rebuild at $10k MRR ($10k-20k cost)

### Path B: Full-Stack
**Timeline:** 14-21 days | **Cost:** $0 + $50/mo | **Code:** Heavy
- Day 1-3: Setup (Next.js + Supabase + Stripe)
- Day 4-12: Build features (auth, upload, matching)
- Day 13-14: Test + launch

**Pros:** Full control, scalable, no migration
**Cons:** Slower, more bugs, less time for dataset

## Success Metrics

| Milestone | Timeline | Metrics |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Week 2** | Day 14 | 100 signups, 10 paid ($490 MRR) |
| **Week 4** | Day 30 | 500 signups, 50 paid ($2.5k MRR) |
| **Week 8** | Day 60 | 1,000 signups, 150 paid ($10k MRR) ← FUNDABLE |
| **Week 12** | Day 90 | 2,000 signups, 300 paid ($20k MRR) ← SERIES A READY |

## Core Features (MVP)

1. **LAB** - 200 films, 2,500 frames, filter by studio/genre/budget
2. **Project Upload** - Title, logline, genre, themes, visual references
3. **Studio Matching** - Algorithm matches to similar funded films
4. **Contact Info** - Development exec emails for each studio
5. **Payments** - $49/mo (7-day trial), 50% student discount

## The Dataset (200 Films to Curate)

**Prioritize (Week 1):**
- A24: 60 films (Moonlight, Hereditary, The Lighthouse, etc.)
- Neon: 30 films (Parasite, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, etc.)
- Annapurna: 25 films (Her, Phantom Thread, etc.)
- MUBI: 25 films (Cold War, Burning, etc.)
- Others: 60 films (IFC, Focus, Bleecker Street)

**For each film:** 10-20 frames tagged by composition, color, lighting, shot type, mood

**See DATASET_STRATEGY.md for full film list.**

## Investment Required

**No-Code Path:**
- One-time: $1,262 (students + domain)
- Monthly: $75 (Softr $49 + Airtable $20 + email $6)
- Your time: 46 hours (Week 1) → 15 hrs/week after

**Full-Stack Path:**
- One-time: $12 (domain) or $5k-10k (contractor)
- Monthly: $50 (Vercel $20 + Supabase $25 + R2 $5)
- Your time: 84 hours (Weeks 1-2) → 15 hrs/week after

## Launch Strategy (Day 7)

**Reddit:**
- r/Filmmakers (1.2M), r/cinematography (300K), r/Screenwriting (2M)
- Post: "I analyzed 200 indie films to help filmmakers find their studio match"
- Offer: First 50 signups get $29/mo (code REDDIT50)

**Twitter:**
- Thread: "I analyzed 60 A24 films. Here's what they fund:"
- Data insights: Genre %, budget sweet spots, visual patterns
- CTA: "Built a tool: cinebox.app"

**Product Hunt:**
- Tuesday launch, 12:01am PST
- Title: "Visual reference library for indie filmmakers"
- Exclusive: First 100 hunters get $29/mo for 6 months

## Growth Channels (Week 2-4)

1. **Film Schools** - Email 50 professors, offer student discount
2. **Sundance Alumni** - LinkedIn outreach (100 filmmakers)
3. **Film Twitter** - Partner with micro-influencers (3-5)
4. **Content** - Blog: "How A24 Picks Films: Visual DNA Analysis"
5. **B2B** - Pitch film schools ($499/mo for unlimited students)

## Fundraising (Month 6)

**Target:** $500k-$1M pre-seed

**Traction Needed:**
- $10k-25k MRR ($120k-300k ARR)
- 1,000+ signups, 200-500 paying users
- 10,000+ frames in dataset
- 2-3 B2B customers

**Pitch:**
> "We're building visual intelligence for film. Started with filmmakers ($25k MRR in 6 months), expanding to games and ads. The moat is the dataset: 10k frames → 300k in Year 1 → proprietary visual AI."

**Valuation:** $3M-5M post-money

## Long-Term Vision

- **Year 1:** Films vertical ($1M ARR, 50k frames)
- **Year 2:** Add games ($5M ARR, 200k frames, launch visual AI)
- **Year 3:** Add advertising ($15M ARR, 500k frames, API licensing)
