## Common Questions

**Q: Which document should I read first?**
**A:** ONE_PAGE_SUMMARY.md (5 minutes)

**Q: I'm ready to start building. Where do I go?**
**A:** START_HERE.md → Day 1 tasks

**Q: I want to understand the dataset strategy. Which doc?**
**A:** DATASET_STRATEGY.md

**Q: I'm torn between no-code and full-stack. Help?**
**A:** DECISION_MATRIX.md (recommendation: no-code for speed)

**Q: What if I want to reuse the existing prototype?**
**A:** New strategy is different (filmmaker tool, not consumer product). Start fresh with Softr or rebuild in Next.js. Can reuse visual components/styling.

**Q: How do I know if I'm making progress?**
**A:** Check task list (#17-18 for this week, #13-16 for future)

**Q: Where's the old PRD?**
**A:** PRD-V2.md (but ignore it - new strategy is better)

**Q: I have 10 minutes. What should I do?**
**A:** Read ONE_PAGE_SUMMARY.md → Choose path (DECISION_MATRIX.md) → Start Day 1 tasks (START_HERE.md)
