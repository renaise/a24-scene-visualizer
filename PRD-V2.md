# CineBox PRD v2.0
**The Film Reference Library for Your Walls**

*Last Updated: 2026-02-12*
*Status: Ready to Ship*

---

## Product Vision

**CineBox is a visual archive of cinema's most iconic scenes.**

Browse by film, mood, or cinematographer. Save your favorites. Display them as art in ambient gallery mode—or order museum-quality prints for your space.

**Think:** Unsplash meets Criterion Collection. A curated library of film stills you can browse, collect, and display.

---

## The Problem

**Film lovers have nowhere to discover and display cinematic moments as art.**

- Criterion stills are scattered across Google Images (low-res, no curation)
- ShotDeck is $149/year and professional-only
- Frame TV art is generic landscapes (not cinematic)
- A24 Shop sells posters, but not individual scene stills
- Pinterest has film frames, but no ambient display mode

**Gap:** No consumer product for browsing, saving, and displaying film scenes as living art.

---

## The Solution

**CineBox = Browse + Save + Display**

1. **Browse:** Grid of curated film scenes (by film, DP, mood, color)
2. **Save:** One-click add to personal collection
3. **Display:** Gallery mode auto-rotates your saved scenes (Frame TV style)
4. **Print:** Order museum-quality physical prints (8x10 to 24x36)

**Category:** Film Archive / Visual Reference Library

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Product | What They Do | Weakness | CineBox Advantage |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **ShotDeck** | Film reference library | $149/year, pro-only | Free tier, consumer-friendly |
| **Frame TV Art** | Ambient display | Generic art, not cinematic | Curated film scenes |
| **Criterion** | Film distribution | No scene browsing | Scene-level discovery |
| **Pinterest** | Visual bookmarking | No ambient mode | Gallery display built-in |
| **Getty/Shutterstock** | Stock imagery | Expensive, commercial-only | Consumer pricing, print-ready |

**CineBox's Unique Position:**
- Only consumer film scene archive with ambient display
- Only product combining browse + save + display + print
- Only freemium film reference library

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Public Domain Content Is "Old/Boring"
**Mitigation:**
- Target cinephiles who love Criterion classics
- Position as "timeless cinema, not nostalgic kitsch"
- Expand to indie partnerships in V2 (modern content)

### Risk 2: Low Print Conversion (Users Don't Buy)
**Mitigation:**
- Free sample program (send 5x7 print to first 100 users)
- Testimonials + social proof
- Limited editions create urgency

### Risk 3: Criterion/A24 Say No to Partnership
**Mitigation:**
- Build leverage first (50K users = distribution channel)
- Show revenue (proof of monetization)
- Offer them 60-70% (they get majority)

### Risk 4: A24 Builds This In-House
**Mitigation:**
- Move fast (ship V1 in 30 days)
- Build community moat (users loyal to CineBox brand)
- Distribution advantage (we already have Frame TV users)

---

## Why This Wins

### 1. **No Licensing Blocker**
Start with public domain = ship immediately. No waiting for A24.

### 2. **Revenue from Day 1**
Print commerce + Pro tier = cashflow from launch.

### 3. **Proof Before Partnership**
10K users + $10K MRR = leverage to negotiate with studios.

### 4. **Multi-Platform**
Web-first (not Frame TV exclusive) = 100x bigger TAM.

### 5. **Sustainable Business Model**
Freemium + print commerce = predictable revenue, not vague "future premium."
