# Visual Dataset Strategy
## The Proprietary Moat for CineBox

**Core Thesis:** The visual dataset is not a feature—it's the business.

---

## Why the Dataset Is the Moat

### The Compound Effect:

**Year 1 (Films Vertical):**
- 200 curated films × 15 frames = 3,000 frames (Day 1)
- 1,000 filmmakers × 30 frames = 30,000 frames (Month 6)
- **Total: 33,000 cinematography frames with expert tags**

**Year 2 (Add Games):**
- Same infrastructure, different vertical
- Game concept artists upload reference frames
- 33,000 → 150,000 frames (film + games)

**Year 3 (Add Advertising):**
- Ad agencies use for commercial production
- 150,000 → 500,000 frames
- **Now you have the largest tagged visual dataset in the world**

### What This Unlocks:

**Year 1-2: Studio Matching**
- Simple tag-based matching
- "Find films like yours"
- Good enough for $1M ARR

**Year 2-3: Proprietary Visual AI**
- Train custom models on your dataset
- Better than CLIP for cinematography
- License to Adobe, Final Cut Pro, etc.

**Year 3+: Visual Intelligence Platform**
- API for visual search (games, ads, film)
- "Google Images for creative professionals"
- $100M+ exit to Adobe/Blackmagic

#### Frame Selection Per Film (10-20 frames):

**Template for Each Film:**

1. **Opening Shot** (1 frame)
   - Establishes tone, location, or visual style
   - Often the most memorable frame

2. **Character Introduction** (1-2 frames)
   - Key characters in defining moments
   - Reveals visual approach to people

3. **Visual Motifs** (2-3 frames)
   - Recurring compositions, colors, or symbols
   - What makes this film visually distinct

4. **Climactic Scenes** (2-3 frames)
   - Emotional peaks
   - Where cinematography serves story

5. **Signature Cinematography** (3-5 frames)
   - DP's best work
   - Award-worthy shots

6. **Memorable Locations** (1-2 frames)
   - Setting as character
   - Production design highlights

**Total: 10-15 frames per film (avg 12.5 = 2,500 frames)**

---

### Phase 2: User-Generated Growth (Month 1-6) - 30,000 Frames

**Filmmaker Uploads:**

#### Incentive Structure:
- Upload 10+ frames → Get 1 month free ($49 value)
- Upload 30+ frames → Get 3 months free ($147 value)
- Upload 50+ frames → Lifetime free (if frames are high quality)

#### Quality Control:
- All frames reviewed before going live
- Must include metadata (film context, themes)
- Reject: low-res, copyrighted stills without permission

#### Growth Math:
- 100 filmmakers × 30 frames = 3,000 frames (Month 1-2)
- 500 filmmakers × 30 frames = 15,000 frames (Month 3-4)
- 1,000 filmmakers × 30 frames = 30,000 frames (Month 5-6)

**Total Dataset (Month 6): 33,000 frames**

---

### Phase 3: Proprietary AI Training (Year 2) - 150,000 Frames

**Dataset Expansion:**
- Games vertical: +50,000 frames (concept art, screenshots)
- Advertising vertical: +30,000 frames (commercials, branded content)
- Film growth: +37,000 frames (2,000 filmmakers)

**Model Training:**

#### What We Can Train (Year 2):
1. **Composition Classifier**
   - Input: Image
   - Output: Rule of thirds, symmetrical, centered, etc.
   - Training cost: $20k-50k (labeled dataset + GPU)

2. **Color Palette Extractor**
   - Input: Image
   - Output: Dominant colors, mood (warm/cool), saturation
   - Training cost: $10k-20k (simpler model)

3. **Mood Predictor**
   - Input: Image
   - Output: Intimate, tense, playful, etc.
   - Training cost: $50k-100k (requires expert labeling)

4. **Visual Similarity (Better than CLIP)**
   - Input: Two images
   - Output: Similarity score (cinematography-specific)
   - Training cost: $100k-200k (custom contrastive learning)

**Total R&D Budget (Year 2): $200k-400k**
Funded by Series A ($3M raise).

## Tagging Workflow (Manual Curation)

### Tools:
- Airtable for data entry
- Custom tagging interface (built in Week 1)
- TMDB API for metadata pre-fill

### Speed:
- 1 film = 12 frames × 2 min per frame = 24 min
- 200 films × 24 min = 80 hours
- 3 days × 10 hours/day = 30 hours (you)
- Hire 2 film students: 50 hours total

### Cost:
- Film students: $25/hr × 50 hrs = $1,250
- Your time: Free (sweat equity)
- **Total: $1,250 one-time cost**

---

## Data Quality Standards

### Frame Requirements:
- Resolution: 1920×1080 minimum (2K+ preferred)
- Aspect ratio: Original (2.35:1, 1.85:1, 16:9, 4:3)
- File size: 500KB-2MB (optimized for web)
- Format: JPG (not PNG, unless necessary)

### Metadata Requirements (Minimum):
- Film title
- Director
- Year
- Studio
- Genre (at least 1)
- Themes (at least 2)
- Composition tags (at least 2)
- Color palette (at least 1)
- Mood (at least 1)

### Quality Control Process:
1. Curator tags frame
2. Second reviewer validates
3. If < 5 tags → reject
4. If low-res → reject
5. If copyrighted without permission → flag

---

## Competitive Advantage

### Why No One Else Has This:

**ShotDeck:**
- 100k+ frames BUT not publicly accessible
- $149/year paywall
- No user uploads (closed dataset)
- **CineBox advantage:** Open growth model

**Pinterest:**
- Billions of images BUT no cinematography tags
- User-generated but no quality control
- **CineBox advantage:** Expert curation + metadata

**TMDB/IMDb:**
- Film stills BUT no cinematography metadata
- Promotional images, not curated frames
- **CineBox advantage:** Frame-level analysis

**Universities:**
- Film studies datasets BUT not digitized
- Academic, not commercial
- **CineBox advantage:** Web-native, API-ready

---

## Long-Term Dataset Vision

### Year 1: 50,000 Frames (Films Only)
- 200 curated films (3,000 frames)

- License dataset to:
  - Adobe (Premiere Pro visual search)
  - Blackmagic (DaVinci Resolve shot matching)
  - Unity/Unreal (game cinematics)
  - Frame.io (video collaboration)
- **Exit: $100M-500M (dataset + AI models)**

## Open Questions

1. **Licensing:** Do we need permission from studios to use film stills?
   - **Answer:** Fair use for educational/reference (consult lawyer)
   - Alternative: Partner with studios (revenue share)

2. **User Uploads:** Do filmmakers own copyright to their frames?
   - **Answer:** Yes (they grant CineBox license to display)
   - Terms: "You retain ownership, we can use for matching"

3. **Training Data:** Can we train AI on user uploads?
   - **Answer:** Yes, if ToS includes this (standard for platforms)
   - Precedent: Instagram, Pinterest, Midjourney

4. **Dataset Moat:** What if someone scrapes our data?
   - **Answer:** The tags are the moat, not the images
   - Defense: Rate limiting, authentication, legal action
